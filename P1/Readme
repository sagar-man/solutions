-------
This program implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for storing file information, such as:
- File path
- Timestamp when it was opened
- Metadata (size, inode, etc.) retrieved using `stat()`

Features:
- Insert new file records into the cache.
- Retrieve file records using the file path.
- Remove least recently used items when the cache reaches capacity.
- Cleanup mechanism to remove old entries beyond a specified expiry time.

Example Usage:
--------------
The `main()` function demonstrates usage by adding, accessing, and cleaning up files.
